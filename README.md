#  SQL Case Study: Data Mart Analysis

##  Introduction
This case study focuses on analyzing the sales performance of **Data Mart**, a venture that adopted sustainable packaging in June 2020. The goal was to evaluate sales trends and performance across regions, platforms, and demographics  change.

Using SQL (MySQL Workbench), I performed **data cleansing** and answered **7 business questions** through structured queries on the `weekly_sales` dataset.

##  Schema Used: `weekly_sales`

| Column Name      | Data Type  |
|------------------|------------|
| week_date        | DATE       |
| region           | VARCHAR(20)|
| platform         | VARCHAR(20)|
| segment          | VARCHAR(10)|
| customer         | VARCHAR(20)|
| transactions     | INT        |
| sales            | INT        |

##  Part A: Data Cleaning Steps

Performed all transformations in a single SQL query and created a new table `clean_weekly_sales`. Key operations included:

- Extracted `week_number`, `month_number`, and `calendar_year` from `week_date`
- Mapped segment codes to `age_band` (e.g., '1' = Young Adults)
- Derived `demographic` based on segment prefix ('C' = Couples, 'F' = Families)
- Replaced all `NULL` and empty values with `'unknown'`
- Created a new column `avg_transaction` as `sales ÷ transactions` (rounded to 2 decimal places)

##  Part B: Data Exploration

Answered the following questions using advanced SQL queries:

1.  **Missing Week Numbers**  
     Identified missing week numbers to find gaps in data collection

2.  **Total Transactions by Year**  
     Summed transactions grouped by calendar year

3.  **Monthly Sales by Region**  
     Analyzed regional performance by month

4.  **Total Transactions by Platform**  
     Compared Retail vs Shopify

5.  **Monthly Sales Percentage – Retail vs Shopify**  
     Calculated platform-wise sales share for each month using `CASE` and `CTE`

6.  **Sales Percentage by Demographic (Yearly)**  
     Used `PARTITION BY` to find each demographic’s sales distribution across years

7.  **Top-Contributing Age Bands & Demographics**  
     Identified the highest-performing customer segments

## Key Insights

Analyzed 1B+ transactions from 2018 to 2020, observing consistent year-over-year growth.

Oceania emerged as the highest revenue-generating region across all months.

Retail dominated sales (~97%), while Shopify showed gradual growth from ~2% to ~3.4%.

Families and Couples were the top revenue-generating demographics, with Retirees contributing the highest Retail sales.

## Tools Used

MySQL

SQL (CTEs, CASE WHEN, Aggregations, Window Functions)

---
## Future Recommendations

- Expand analysis to full 52-week data to enable accurate seasonality and annual trend forecasting.
- Use demographic and regional insights to design targeted promotions for high-value segments like Families and Retirees.


##  Key Learnings
- Performed real-world data transformation and reporting entirely in SQL
- Gained hands-on experience with `CTEs`, `CASE`, `GROUP BY`, and `PARTITION BY`
- Understood how to draw insights from sales data using pure SQL
